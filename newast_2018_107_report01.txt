-------- response to the editor --------
As mentioned in the responce letter to the authors the submitted paper contains an interesting study that will potentially find a good resonance in scientific discussions about fragmentation of molecular clouds and the onset of star formation.
However, the language, as well as the structure of the paper really needs to improve as the way the paper is written is unclear and very confusing. 
I hope that the authors will regard my comments on that issue particularly careful, as I do not think I can approve the paper at any point in its current version. 
If the guidelines of the journal should, though, ask me to only evaluate the content of the paper and leave the linguitic refinement for later revision, I would appreciate it if you tell me as soon as possible.
